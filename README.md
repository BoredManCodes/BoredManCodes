Hi there!
Not sure why you are checking out my profile, but welcome, brush off the dust and cobwebs and have a look around<br>
Don't judge my code too much 🙏 I'm still learning and most of this is BoredCode™ and just barely works

# Coding stats

<p>As you can see, I do mostly Python 🐍 programs, but am open to trying nearly any other language</p>
